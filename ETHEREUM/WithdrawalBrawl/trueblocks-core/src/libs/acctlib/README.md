## acctlib

The acctlib provides functionality to store per-account data, such as a list of transactions of interest for an account, in a quickly accessible 16-way tree data structure [5] keyed by account address. This data structure lends itself very well to storing per-account data particularly given the nature of the indexing key which is a 20-byte account address.While this is not how TrueBlocks￢iis actually implements storing per account data, conceptually, as each block is produced, we extract the list of transactions from that block. The transactions are traversed searching for accounts involved in that transaction. For each such account, we append the blockNumber.transID to the end of that account￢ﾀﾙs growing list of references. These lists of ￢ﾀﾜinteresting￢ﾀﾝ blocks and transactions are stored in the tree keyed by account address.We say “conceptually” above because TrueBlocks™ does not actually do this processing at each block. Instead, and in response to our desire to minimize the impact of our work on the target machine, we store these lists only when requested by an end user. This minimize the on-disc size of the growing account-bases list of transactions.As requests are made to certain tools and applications the 16-way tree data structure provides very fast access, to the list per account.This library is currently experimental.
